CiviCRM extension to allow a parent to register their children for an event

Directions:

1) Installing this extension

2) Create a new paid event (or edit an existing paid event).

3) Go to the event configuration tab "Online Registration" and choose to "allow online registration" and "Use Enhanced Registration?"

4) (Optional) Check the box to allow "Register multiple participants?" (This will allow a parent to register multiple children as part of one registration)

5) In the section for selecting "Include Profile"  be sure to select an appropriate profile to collect data for each child. ( eg such as a profile named "Student Info" )  All data from the selected profile will be recorded on the child's contact/participant record. Do NOT ask for any data about the parent or emergancy contacts in this profile.

6) Test out your event!   You should see the profile(s) that you selected on step 5, 
along with profiles for "Current User" ( ie parent 1), "Other Parent Or Guardian", and 2 emergancy contacts. 


After someone registers their child, you should see 6 contact records in the back office: One household contact, contact records for each parent, contact records for each emergancy contact, and a contact and partcipant record for each child.  The primary parent and the children will ALWAYS be given the relationship
